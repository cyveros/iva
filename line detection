1. Find all the edge points in the image using any suitable edge
detection scheme.
2. Quantize the (m,c) space into a two-dimensional matrix H with
appropriate quantization levels.
3. Initialize the matrix H to zero.
4. Each element of H matrix, ( , ) i i H m c , which is found to correspond to
an edge point is incremented by 1. The result is a histogram or a
vote matrix showing the frequency of edge points corresponding to
certain (m,c) values (i.e. points lying on a common line).
5. The histogram H is thresholded where only the large valued
elements are taken. These elements correspond to lines in the
original image.
